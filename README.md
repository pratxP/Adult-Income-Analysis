# Adult-Income-Analysis

## Introduction
The adult income dataset provides insights into various socio-economic factors that may influence an individual's income level. This analysis aims to explore the relationships between attributes such as education, occupation, demographics, and income, ultimately identifying potential areas for policy interventions and initiatives to promote equal opportunities.

## Problem Statement
Income disparities can have far-reaching consequences on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. Understanding the factors contributing to these disparities is crucial for developing effective strategies to address economic inequality and ensure equitable access to resources and opportunities.

## Objectives
- Analyze the adult income dataset to identify key factors influencing income levels (KNN, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression).
- Develop visualizations and statistical models to effectively communicate findings [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)].
- Provide data-driven recommendations for policy reforms and initiatives.
- Explore potential income disparities across different demographic groups (The classifiers and regression models).

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Accuracy of predictive models for income levels.
- Actionability and feasibility of proposed recommendations.
- Identification of significant variables impacting income.
- Quantification of income gaps across different groups (education, occupation, race, sex, etc.).

### Potential Outcomes:
- Identification of vulnerable or underrepresented groups facing income disparities.
- Data-driven decision-making for resource allocation and policy formulation.
- Increased awareness among policymakers and stakeholders regarding income inequality issues.
- Promotion of equal opportunities and social mobility.
- Development of targeted policies and programs to address specific income gaps.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix
